Revision history for Pantable
=============================

-  v0.14.0: Support pandoc 2.14

   -  close #61
   -  requires panflute >= 2.1
   -  add ``environment.yml`` for an example conda environment running pantable
   -  remove ``pantable.util.PandocVersion`` as it is merged upstream in ``panflute.tools.PandocVersion``.

-  v0.13.6: Fix #57; update dependencies.
-  v0.13.5: Fix a division error when all widths are zero.
-  v0.13.4: Fix converting from native table that contains footnotes. See #58.
-  v0.13.3: packaging change only: allow Python4
-  v0.13.2: packaging change only: specified required versions for all dependencies including extras
-  v0.13.1: util.py: fix ``iter_convert_texts_markdown_to_panflute``
-  v0.13:added pandoc 2.11.0.4+ & panflute 2+ support

   -  pandoc 2.10 introduces a new table AST. This version provides complete support of all features supported in the pandoc AST. Hence, older pandoc versions are no longer supported. Install ``pantable=0.12.4`` if you need to use ``pandoc<2.10``.
   -  deprecated ``pipe_tables``, ``grid_tables``, ``raw_markdown`` options in pantable, which were introduced in v0.12. pantable v0.13 has a much better way to process markdown cells that these are no longer needed.
   -  slight changes on markdown output which should be functionally identical. Both changes in pandoc and pantable cause this. See commit eadc6fb.
   -  add ``short-caption``, ``alignment-cells``, ``fancy_table``, ``format``, ``ms``, ``ns_head``. See docs for details.

-  v0.12.4: Require panflute<2 explicitly

   -  panflute 2 is released to support pandoc API 1.22. This release ensures that version control is correct when people specify pantable==0.12 in the future.

-  v0.12.3: Fixes test and CI; update on supported Python versions

   -  migrate from Travis CI to GitHub Actions
   -  supported Python versions are now 3.5-3.8, pypy3
   -  minor update in README

-  v0.12.2: Add ``grid_tables``
-  v0.12.1: add ``include-encoding``, ``csv-kwargs``

   -  closes #36, #38. See doc for details on this new keys.

-  v0.12: Drop Python 2 support; enhance CSV with markdown performance

   -  Dropping Python2 support, existing Python 2 users should be fine with pip>=9.0. See https://python3statement.org/practicalities/.

   -  add ``pipe_tables``, ``raw_markdown`` options. See README for details. This for example will speed up CSV with markdown cells a lot (trading correctness for speed though.)
